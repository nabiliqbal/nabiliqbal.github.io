  This is an interactive art installation that shows a battle between entropy and order. Click inside to activate and give microphone permission. Speak into your computer microphone to increase the level of disorder.

  Technical note to judges of Baltic 39 Open Call: if approved this could be hung in various ways, e.g. on an iPad or a hanging computer screen with a microphone (it uses little processing power and could share a screen with other works.)
  Here I have chosen to present a version that runs in a web browser for ease of submission. If it does not respond to your voice, please <a href = "https://editor.p5js.org/nabil.iqbal/present/nBjgwmI92"> try this version </a>, or try a different browser (i.e. Chrome and Opera work well)
